# GOLD-TRADE-IN-SOUTH-AFRICA-AND-UGANDA
This project analyzes gold trade between BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) and other nations from 2017 to 2023.

# 🟡 Gold Trade Analysis: South Africa vs Uganda (2017–2023)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project investigates the gold trade dynamics between South Africa and Uganda using international trade data from the UN Comtrade database (2017–2023). It explores how global events like COVID-19, regional conflicts, and BRICS economic strategies influenced gold export volumes, pricing, and trade behavior.

## 🧾 Objectives
- Analyze gold export trends before, during, and after global crises.
- Compare South Africa and Uganda in terms of:
  - Export volume and FOB value
  - Trade reporting infrastructure
  - Resilience and recovery patterns
- Understand gold price volatility and geopolitical influences.

## 📊 Data Source
- **UN Comtrade Database**
- **HS Codes**: `7108`, `710811`, `710812`, `710813`, `710820`

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**: Data wrangling, analysis
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data processing & visualization
- **PowerPoint**: Final presentation
- **UN Comtrade API**: Raw trade data extraction

---

## 🔍 Key Findings
### 📈 Trends & Patterns
- South Africa had more consistent and high-volume exports due to diversified resources and advanced trade infrastructure.
- Uganda saw rapid growth post-2020 due to oil sector development and regional trade agreements like AfCFTA.
- COVID-19 triggered a surge in gold as a safe haven; post-vaccine era saw a shift back to equity markets.

### 🌍 Global Event Impact
- **2020**: COVID-19 disrupted global supply chains but gold exports remained strong.
- **2022**: Russia-Ukraine war raised fuel costs and disrupted shipping, impacting exports.
- **2023**: BRICS expansion and AfCFTA implementation led to record-high export values (3.41T).

### 🧮 Price Analysis
- Gold prices showed volatility due to:
  - USD strength
  - Inflation expectations
  - Geopolitical tensions

### 🔁 Trade Discrepancies
- UAE’s gold import slowdown in 2021 was due to anti-smuggling regulations.
- Some nations purchased gold below World Bank prices due to informal trade routes or lack of monitoring.

## 💡 Conclusion
South Africa's advantage lies in its advanced logistics and BRICS affiliation, whereas Uganda is catching up through oil investments and regional cooperation. Both countries reflect the evolving nature of African trade in response to global economic shocks and opportunities.
